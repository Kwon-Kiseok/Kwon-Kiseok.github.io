  2년차 모바일 게임 클라이언트 개발자로, Unity를 이용한 모바일 게임 제작 경험이 있습니다. 4인 팀에서 기획자와 1:1로 작업하며, 기획 단계부터 주도적으로 참여했습니다. 프로토타입 개발부터 광고 테스트 영상 제작, 게임 개발까지 다양한 프로젝트를 진행했습니다.

  개발한 내용에 대한 재검증과 최적화를 통한 개선을 중요시하며, 문제 발생 시 또는 추가 개선점이 생각났을 때 기록을 통해 복기하고 더 좋은 방향으로 개선하는 일을 즐깁니다. 기능 구현에 그치지 않고 개발 역량을 향상시키는 데 항상 노력하였습니다.

  아트와 사업 파트와의 소통도 중요시하며, 모르는 부분에 대한 질문, 의견 제시, 다른 의견 수용 등을 통해 게임 개발에서의 팀워크를 유지하려 노력합니다. 동료들과의 커뮤니케이션의 중요성을 인지하고 있으며, 이에 대한 자신감을 가지고 있습니다.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
